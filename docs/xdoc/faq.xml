            <h3 id="how-rule-engine">
                1. How to plug a new Rule Engine?
            </h3>
            <p>There are two ways and please follow the <a href="extensions_guide.html">extending BRS Guide</a> and  <a href="configuration_language.html">Configuration Guide</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="how-fact-add">
                2. How to register new fact and result adapters?
            </h3>
            <p>Please follow the extending BRS guide and configuration guide.</p>
            <h3 id="how-qos">
                3. Can I configure security, reliability, etc (QoS) for a rule service?
            </h3>
            <p>Yes, you can easily do. A rule service is similar to an axis2 service. You can
                configure QoS for a rule service through service management admin UI or manually
                editing services.xml of a rule service
            </p>
            <h3 id="can-rule-mediator">
                4. Can I used the rules in the mediators of WSO2 ESB ?
            </h3>
            <p>Yes, Rule component has been integrated to the WSO2 ESB as a mediator. There are a
                set of samples demonstrating it. Please checks the rule sample guide in the WSO2 ESB
                documentation
            </p>
            <h3 id="when-services-xml">
                5. When should I use a services.xml along with the rule service?
            </h3>
            <p>If you need to take features offered by the services.xml such as setting session scope , then you have to use a services.xml.
            </p>
            <h3 id="when-aar-file">
                6. When should I use the rule service archive (.aar)?
            </h3>
            <p>If you have facts as a Jar file, rule set as a file, or if you require a services.xml (Axis2 Service Configuration), then, the rule service (.aar) should be used.
