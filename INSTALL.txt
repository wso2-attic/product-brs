NOTE: The system property, applyPatches (-DapplyPatches), is no longer used. We have automated the patch application/reverting process. 
Drop the patches to $CARBON_HOME/repository/componenets/patches directory and restart the system WITHOUT this system property. 
When you want to revert a patch, delete it from the patches directory and restart the system WITHOUT this property.

=======================
1. Minimum memory - 1GB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
